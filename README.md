# Google Docs to Roblox GUI

This program does exactly what it says. Enter a Google Docs URL, and it will parse its contents, including images, into a GUI that can be used in Roblox games. 
However, this GitHub repository is only the **Python side of the program**. Because there's no descent Luau Roblox HTML web parser, a server is currently hosting all 
of the functionality in Python.
Please see the official [Roblox DevForum post](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/rodocker-generate-custom-roblox-books-from-google-docs-in-just-one-click/1182352?u=aerodynamicrocket) 
for more information.

Potential updates:

- Would be nice to see a Luau HTML parser to stop depending on a Python server
